"""# Home Price Prediction using Linear Regression  

## 📖 Introduction  
This project applies **Linear Regression** to predict house prices based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location, etc.  
The aim is to understand relationships between features and prices, and build a predictive model for housing price analysis.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Load and preprocess housing dataset.  
- Perform **EDA** (exploratory data analysis).  
- Apply **Linear Regression** for price prediction.  
- Evaluate model performance using error metrics.  
- Provide insights into factors affecting house prices.

## 📊 Dataset Description  
- Features: area (sqft), bedrooms, bathrooms, location, etc.  
- Target Variable: house price.  
- Format: CSV/Excel dataset.
- 
Methodology  
1. Data Loading – Import dataset into pandas DataFrame.  
2. Data Preprocessing – Handle missing values, encode categorical features.  
3. EDA – Analyze price distribution, correlations, and outliers.  
4. Model Building – Train a **Linear Regression model** using scikit-learn.  
5. Evaluation – Metrics: R², Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), RMSE.

## 📈 Results & Insights  
- Linear Regression explains housing prices with interpretable coefficients.  
- Key influential features: area, location, number of bedrooms/bathrooms.  
- Residual analysis indicates areas for potential improvement.

 Requirements  
- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn  

Install dependencies:  
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter

## ▶️ Usage  
1. Clone/download this repository.  
2. Place dataset (e.g., home_prices.csv) in project folder.  
3. Run Jupyter Notebook step by step to preprocess data, build model, and evaluate predictions.
